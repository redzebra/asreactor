and run `bundle install` from your shell.

## Credentials and Permissions

Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_REGION in the environment before running asreactor. (TODO: support credentials in the configuration file.) Instance profiles are supported as an alternative.

asreactor requires the following IAM permissions:

  - sns:Subscribe
  - sns:Unsubscribe
  - sqs:CreateQueue
  - sqs:DeleteMessage
  - sqs:DeleteQueue
  - sqs:GetQueueAttributes
  - sqs:ReceiveMessage
  - sqs:SetQueueAttributes

**This list is probably incomplete and is likely to change.**

## AWS Costs

**asreactor will incur costs in Amazon Web Services and you use it at your own
risk.** The costs will normally be negligible but this software may contain
bugs which result in runaway SQS use.

See [Amazon SQS Pricing][Amazon SQS Pricing] for further details of costs.
